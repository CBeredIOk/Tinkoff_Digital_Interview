    Challenge from Tinkoff to pass 10 tests on 3 different tasks

        https://interview.tinkoff.ru/picnic

        Task:

        decompose a number into the sum of DIGITS
        Must output at least one seven
        Must output at least one two
        There must be negative numbers
        Numbers must output first in descending order and then in ascending order
        The decomposition must have a digit from the hexadecimal system (A, B, C, D, E, F)
        There should be a duck emoji in the code
        There should be no "for" and "while" loops
        The code must output a hexadecimal digit that is not in the code (i.e. if there is no d anywhere in the code, you can output D)
        And something else, but I don't remember.....
        To make this code pass all 10 tests, you should delete all comments (except for the duck emoji)
